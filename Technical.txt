Comprehensive Documentation for Financial News Summarization and Sentiment Analysis Pipeline


1. Methodologies for Summarization and Sentiment Analysis
Summarization Methodology
Data Collection:
Extract data from financial sources such as Bloomberg, Reuters, Financial Times, and Finance.si using web scraping tools (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy) and APIs (NewsAPI).
Preprocessing:
Clean the data by removing HTML tags, special characters, and stopwords.
Normalize text (lowercase) and tokenize it into words/sentences.
Extract metadata (e.g., publication date, source).
Model Selection:
Use T5 (text-to-text transformer) for generating concise summaries.
Alternatively, use BERT for extractive summarization where needed.
Evaluation:
Measure summarization quality using ROUGE metrics (e.g., ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L).
Adjust the model parameters to optimize summary length and relevance.
Sentiment Analysis Methodology
Input Preparation:
Take summaries from Phase 1 as input for sentiment analysis.
Tokenize and clean text for consistency.
Model Selection:
Use FinBERT, pre-trained for financial sentiment classification, to classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.
Enhancements:
Fine-tune FinBERT on custom financial datasets if needed.
Classify degrees of sentiment (e.g., strongly positive, mildly negative) using confidence thresholds.
Evaluation:
Compute metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.
Use labeled test data for validation.
2. Insights on Model, Libraries, and Tool Selection
Models:
T5: Chosen for its flexibility in abstractive summarization.
Example: Summarizing an article about "market trends affecting XYZ Corp." into key points.
FinBERT: Tailored for financial sentiment analysis.
Example: Determining if a report on "stock volatility" conveys positive or negative sentiment.
Libraries:
Preprocessing: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Pandas, re
Model Usage: HuggingFace's transformers
Evaluation: ROUGE, sklearn for F1-scores
Visualization: Grafana for creating interactive dashboards.
Tools:
APIs: NewsAPI to fetch financial articles programmatically.
Grafana: To visualize sentiment trends and summarization performance effectively.

Functional Scripts
1. Preprocessing
clean_data.py:
Removes HTML tags, special characters, and normalizes text.
2. Summarization
summarize_t5.py:
Loads T5 model, generates summaries, and saves outputs.
rouge_evaluation.py:
Computes ROUGE metrics for summary quality.
3. Sentiment Analysis
analyze_sentiment.py:
Loads FinBERT, classifies sentiment, and handles ambiguous terms.
fine_tune_finbert.py:
Provides functionality to fine-tune the sentiment model using domain-specific datasets.
4. Visualization
grafana_export.py:
Exports summarized and sentiment data to a database.
grafana_setup.md:
Provides instructions to create interactive dashboards.
Evaluation Metrics
Summarization:
Use ROUGE scores to compare generated summaries with reference summaries.
Example: ROUGE-1 score of 80% for overlap of unigrams.
Sentiment Analysis:
Use F1-score to balance precision and recall.
Example: Achieving an F1-score of 85% on test data.
