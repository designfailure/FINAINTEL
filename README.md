# FINAINTEL
""Financial AI and News Intelligence"" -  financial news summarization and sentiment analysis pipeline

The #workflow overview focuses on summarizing financial news articles through a structured approach involving data collection, preprocessing, summarization, and output storage. The phase pipeline also involves analyzing the sentiment of the summarized articles.

Data Collection involves gathering financial news articles through two primary methods. The first method is Web Scraping, utilizing libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Scrapy to extract articles from reputable financial news sources like Bloomberg, Reuters, and Financial Times. The second method is API Integration, where tools like NewsAPI are employed to programmatically fetch articles, ensuring a steady stream of relevant content.

Following data collection, the Data Preprocessing stage is crucial. This includes Text Cleaning, which removes special characters, HTML tags, and stop words to enhance the quality of the text. Next, Text Normalization converts all text to lowercase and applies stemming to reduce words to their base forms. The text is then split into manageable pieces through Tokenization, allowing for easier analysis. Additionally, Metadata Extraction captures essential information such as publication date, source, and relevant tags.

The core of this phase is the Summarization process. Here, model selection is pivotal; pre-trained models like T5 and BERT are utilized to generate concise summaries that reflect the main points and essential details of the original articles. The final output consists of these summaries stored in a structured format such as JSON or CSV.

Additional preprocessing ensures that these summaries are clean and tokenized for effective analysis. The heart of this phase is the Sentiment Analysis, which involves selecting an appropriate model like FinBERT for sentiment classification. Each summary is classified as positive, negative, or neutral based on its content. Furthermore, the analysis distinguishes between varying degrees of sentiment, such as strongly positive or mildly negative.

The output from this phase includes Sentiment Scores, which are stored in a structured format for further use.
Finally, an Evaluation step assesses the performance of both the summarization and sentiment analysis models using metrics like ROUGE and F-1 scores. Visualization tools such as Grafana are employed to present results and performance metrics clearly.

This comprehensive workflow effectively combines data collection, processing, summarization, sentiment analysis, and evaluation to provide valuable insights into financial news trends and sentiments.
